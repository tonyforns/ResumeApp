Hi! My name is Antonio Forns, 29 year old and I’m from Argentina. Since I was a child I was passionate about videogames and that moved me to study something that could introduce me more to that world so I graduated as a Computer Engineer on the [Universidad Nacional de Tucuman](http://www.unt.edu.ar/) and I found my second love, programming. I have never felt that I worked when I was coding, for me it is the opposite, I enjoy it and it is like playing.
